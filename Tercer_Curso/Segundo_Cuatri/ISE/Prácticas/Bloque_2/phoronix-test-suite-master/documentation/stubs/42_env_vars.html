<h2>DONT_BALANCE_TESTS_FOR_SUBSYSTEMS</h2>
<p><em>If this value is true, the Phoronix Test Suite stress-run manager will not attempt to distribute the selected test(s) among available hardware subsystems. For stress runs with tests covering multiple subsystems (e.g. CPU, GPU, RAM), the default behavior is try to ensure the tests to run concurrently are as balanced across the tested subsystems as possible.</em></p>
<p>The value can be of type: boolean (TRUE / FALSE).
The variable is relevant for: stress-run mode.
</p>
<h2>DONT_TRY_TO_ENSURE_TESTS_ARE_UNIQUE</h2>
<p><em>When running in the stress-run mode, the default behavior will try to ensure when tests are running concurrently that as many unique tests as possible are being run. Setting this value to try will avoid that check and just attempt to truly randomize the tests being run concurrently without regard for trying to avoid duplicates.</em></p>
<p>The value can be of type: boolean (TRUE / FALSE).
The variable is relevant for: stress-run mode.
</p>
<h2>FORCE_ABSOLUTE_MIN_TIMES_TO_RUN</h2>
<p><em>This option is similar to FORCE_MIN_TIMES_TO_RUN but is *absolute* in ensuring each test will run at least that number of times and not subject to change of any timed cut-offs or other factors.</em></p>
<p>The value can be of type: positive integer.
The variable is relevant for: test execution / benchmarking.
</p>
<h2>FORCE_MIN_DURATION_PER_TEST</h2>
<p><em>This option can be used to specify the minimum number of times to run a given benchmark. Rather than relying on a static times-to-run count, the test will keep looping until the time has exceeded this number (in minutes).</em></p>
<p>The value can be of type: positive integer.
The variable is relevant for: test execution / benchmarking.
</p>
<h2>FORCE_MIN_TIMES_TO_RUN</h2>
<p><em>This option is similar to FORCE_TIMES_TO_RUN but is used for specifying the minimum possible number of times to run. Unlike FORCE_TIMES_TO_RUN, the run count can still exceed this value if the deviation between results or other factors are too high.</em></p>
<p>The value can be of type: positive integer.
The variable is relevant for: test execution / benchmarking.
</p>
<h2>FORCE_MIN_TIMES_TO_RUN_CUTOFF</h2>
<p><em>Used in conjunction with the FORCE_MIN_TIMES_TO_RUN, the FORCE_MIN_TIMES_TO_RUN_CUTOFF can be used for specifyingg the amount of time (in minutes) before foregoing additional runs. This allows cutting off the testing early if this time threshold has been reached.</em></p>
<p>The value can be of type: positive integer.
The variable is relevant for: test execution / benchmarking.
</p>
<h2>FORCE_TIMES_TO_RUN</h2>
<p><em>This option can be used to override the default number of times a given test is run. Rather than being specified by the individual test profile, FORCE_TIMES_TO_RUN allows for specifying the number of times to run each benchmark.</em></p>
<p>The value can be of type: positive integer.
The variable is relevant for: test execution / benchmarking.
</p>
<h2>FORCE_TIMES_TO_RUN_MULTIPLE</h2>
<p><em>This option is similar to FORCE_TIMES_TO_RUN but the value is a multiple for how many times the test profile should be run respective to its default value. If the value is set to 2 and a given test profile by default is set to run 3 times, it would now instead be run a total of 6 times. This can be used for increasing the statistical significance of test results by using a multiple of the default rather than a static number as is the case with FORCE_TIMES_TO_RUN.</em></p>
<p>The value can be of type: positive integer.
The variable is relevant for: test execution / benchmarking.
</p>
<h2>GRAPH_HIGHLIGHT</h2>
<p><em>If automatically generating an HTML or PDF result file from the command-line and wanting to highlight desired result identifier(s), GRAPH_HIGHLIGHT can be set to a comma delimited list of result identifiers to highlight / color differently than the rest.</em></p>
<p>The value can be of type: string.
The variable is relevant for: result output generation.
</p>
<h2>IGNORE_RUNS</h2>
<p><em>This option can be used if wanting the Phoronix Test Suite to automatically toss out a specified result position when running a test profile multiple times. E.g. setting this value to 1 will toss out automatically the first run of each test profile or a value of 3 will toss out the third run of a given test. This overrides the IgnoreRuns option also available to individual test profiles. Multiple values for runs to ignore can be specified by delimiting with a comma.</em></p>
<p>The value can be of type: string.
The variable is relevant for: test execution / benchmarking.
</p>
<h2>LIMIT_ELAPSED_TEST_TIME</h2>
<p><em>This option can be used for limiting the amount of time the benchmarking process runs. The value specified is the number of minutes to allow for benchmarking. After a test finishes if that number of minutes has been exceeded, the testing process will abort early and not run any remaining tests.</em></p>
<p>The value can be of type: positive integer.
The variable is relevant for: test execution / benchmarking.
</p>
<h2>LINUX_PERF</h2>
<p><em>This option allows providing additional complementary per-test graphs looking at various Linux perf subsystem metrics such as cache usage, instructions executed, and other metrics. This requires you to have Linux's perf user-space utility already installed and performance counter access.</em></p>
<p>The value can be of type: boolean (TRUE / FALSE).
The variable is relevant for: test execution / benchmarking.
The variable depends upon functionality provided by the Phoronix Test Suite module: linux_perf.
</p>
<h2>LOG_CLI_OUTPUT</h2>

<p>The value can be of type: boolean (TRUE / FALSE).
</p>
<h2>MONITOR</h2>
<p><em>This option can be used for system sensor monitoring during test execution. The Phoronix Test Suite system_monitor module can monitor various exposed sensors and record them as part of the result file and present them as additional graphs / metrics in the result viewer. The exposed sensors varies by platform hardware/software. This functionality also requires PHP PCNTL support and thus is not available for some platforms (i.e. Windows).</em></p>
<p>The value can be of type: enumeration (all, cpu.peak-freq, cpu.temp, cpu.power, cpu.usage, gpu.freq, gpu.power, gpu.temp, hdd.temp, memory.usage, swap.usage, sys.power, sys.temp)

<p>The value can be of type: boolean (TRUE / FALSE).
</p>
<h2>NO_COMPILER_MASK</h2>
<p><em>By default the Phoronix Test Suite attempts to determine the intended system code compilers (namely C / C++ / Fortran) and to intercept the arguments being passed to them during test installation in order to record the prominent compiler flags being used. If this behavior causes problems for your system, NO_COMPILER_MASK can be enabled for debugging purposes to avoid this compiler intercepting/symlinking behavior.</em></p>
<p>The value can be of type: boolean (TRUE / FALSE).
The variable is relevant for: test installation.
</p>
<h2>NO_DOWNLOAD_CACHE</h2>
<p><em>Enable this option if the Phoronix Test Suite should not attempt to discover and use any local/remote Phoronix Test Suite download cache when installing tests and attempting to find those files locally or on a LAN resource.</em></p>

The variable is relevant for: test installation.
</p>
<h2>NO_EXTERNAL_DEPENDENCIES</h2>
<p><em>Enabling this option will have the Phoronix Test Suite skip over attempting to detect and install any system/external dependencies needed to run desired test profiles. This should just be used in case of testing/evaluation purposes and may leave some tests unable to successfully build/install.</em></p>
<p>The value can be of type: boolean (TRUE / FALSE).
The variable is relevant for: test installation.
</p>
<h2>NO_FILE_HASH_CHECKS</h2>
<p><em>Enable this option if you want to skip the MD5 / SHA256 file hash checks after downloading files with known MD5/SHA256 hashsums for verification.

<p>The value can be of type: boolean (TRUE / FALSE).
</p>
<h2>NO_PHODEVI_CACHE</h2>
<p><em>This option will disable use of the built-in Phodevi (Phoronix Device Interface) cache of system software/hardware details. When enabled, the information is not cached and will be re-computed on each query. This is mainly useful for debugging purposes.</em></p>
<p>The value can be of type: boolean (TRUE / FALSE).
</p>
<h2>OUTPUT_DIR</h2>
<p><em>When exporting a result file, this option can be used for specifying the writable directory path where the exported result files should be saved to. The file-name will be automatically generated.</em></p>
<p>The value can be of type: string.
The variable is relevant for: result output generation.
</p>
<h2>OUTPUT_FILE</h2>

<p>The value can be of type: string.
The variable is relevant for: result output generation.
</p>
<h2>PHODEVI_SANITIZE</h2>
<p><em>This option can be used for stripping out part of a string on Phodevi (Phoronix Device Interface) hardware/software properties.

The value will be removed from read Phodevi hardware/software properties if set. Multiple strings to search for can be set by delimiting with a comma. If wanting to limit the sanitization to a particular property, the property value can be specified such as [property]=[value] to sanitisze like a value of "motherboard=ABCVENDOR" or CPU=ENGINEERING-SAMPLE to delete those strings rather than simply the string to remove that will look for matches in any property."</em></p>
<p>The value can be of type: string.
</p>
<h2>PRESET_OPTIONS</h2>
<p><em>PRESET_OPTIONS can be used for seeding the values of test profile run options from the environment (though the preferred approach for pre-configuring tests in an automated manner would be by constructing your own local test suite).  For setting any test option(s) from an environment variable rather than being prompted for the options when running a test. Example: "PRESET_OPTIONS='stream.run-type=Add' phoronix-test-suite benchmark stream".</em></p>
<p>The value can be of type: string.
The variable is relevant for: test execution / benchmarking.
</p>
<h2>PRESET_OPTIONS_VALUES</h2>
<p><em>This option is similar to PRESET_OPTIONS and uses the same syntax but rather than seeding the selected run option it uses the value verbatim as for what is passed to the test profile run option.</em></p>
